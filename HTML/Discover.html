            In the age of Kalyug, chanting (Japam) is regarded as the most effective way to connect with the 
            Supreme God and the universe, 
            as emphasized in the Bhagavad Gita and other 
            scriptures. Lord Krishna states in the Gita (10.25), "Among sacrifices, I am the sacrifice of chanting," 
            highlighting its spiritual significance. 
            Unlike previous ages where meditation or rituals were predominant, chanting is considered the most accessible practice in Kalyug due to its simplicity and power.
            The Kali Santarana Upanishad also prescribes the chanting of the
            Hare Krishna Maha Mantra as a means to overcome the challenges of this age and attain liberation. By repeating the divine names, one invokes spiritual energy, 
            attains peace, and connects deeply with the Supreme. Chanting is thus regarded as a universal path to liberation and divine connection in this era.
